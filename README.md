# JC2Rec
is a GUI in Qt for recording speech using Codec2

[Codec2] is an audio compression codec designed for speech.  
The codec is designed for very high compression ratios.  
It has bit rates as low as 450 bits per second!!!

I wrote this application to make audio recordings with this audio compressor.

### Building

You will need the [codec2 repo] cloned into a directory above the jc2rec repo.  
You'll have to build codec2 and have all the required QT things.  
On Windows I suggest using [MSYS2] to install everything needed.
